# GitHub Actions Learning Repository

Welcome to my GitHub Actions learning repository! This project is a hands-on exploration of GitHub Actions, a powerful CI/CD automation platform offered by GitHub. Here, I document my journey of learning and experimenting with GitHub Actions, from basic workflows to advanced automation techniques.

This repository has been created along with the **"GitHub Actions - The Complete Guide"**, which covers everything from the fundamentals to building custom actions and securing workflows.

I've added all the repositories created in the course as new branches, and also made modifications to make experiments.

## üöÄ What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) platform that allows you to automate workflows directly within your GitHub repository. With GitHub Actions, you can build, test, and deploy your applications, as well as automate repository management tasks.

Key features:

- **Event-driven workflows**: Trigger workflows based on GitHub events like `push`, `pull_request`, or `issue`.
- **Reusable workflows and actions**: Share and reuse workflows across repositories.
- **Matrix builds**: Test across multiple environments simultaneously.
- **Custom actions**: Create your own actions using JavaScript, Docker, or composite run steps.
- **Security**: Securely manage secrets, environments, and permissions.
